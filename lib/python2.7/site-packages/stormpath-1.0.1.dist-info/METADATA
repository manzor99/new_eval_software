Stormpath SDK
-------------

DESCRIPTION

The Stormpath Python SDK allows any Python-based application to easily use
the Stormpath user management service for all authentication and
access control needs.

When you make SDK method calls, the calls are translated into HTTPS
requests to the Stormpath REST+JSON API. The Stormpath Python SDK provides
a clean object-oriented paradigm natural to Python developers and
alleviates the need to know how to make REST+JSON requests.
